# Performance Data Visualizer

This app displays data gathered by performance tests. It consumes REST API with [this](https://github.com/SemaiCZE/spl-evaluation-java/blob/master/api-doc/swagger.yaml) specification. Originally there is only one API implementation for JMH benchmarks via [spl-evaluation-java](https://github.com/SemaiCZE/spl-evaluation-java/) project, more may come later.

## Available Scripts

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
